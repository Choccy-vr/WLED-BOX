# Total Time Spent: 8h

# June 19th: Started Project & PCB

- Started a new project, how cool!

- Decided to do a small WLED controller because controllers on any other marketplace place too overkill or too expensive

- I finished the PCB Schematic 

- I decided to go with the ESP32 C3 Xiao because Seeed Studio has great footprints and symbols already, and they are small, along with an extra LED Light

- I also finished V1 of the PCB

# June 20th: CAD and Finishing Touches

- I finished the case 

- I added a cool hexagon pattern mostly becuase it looks cool but it also helps with air flow

- I added the USB C Pwr in and the LED OUT

- I also added the ESP's USB port in the case to allow for easy flashing

- I am also working on getting it submitted  BOM, ReadMe, etc
