# June 19th: Started Project & PCB

- Started a new project, how cool!

- Decided to do a small WLED controller because controllers on any other marketplace place too overkill or too expensive

- I finished the PCB Schematic 

- I decided to go with the ESP32 C3 Xiao because Seeed Studio has great footprints and symbols already, and they are small, along with an extra LED Light

- I also finished V1 of the PCB
